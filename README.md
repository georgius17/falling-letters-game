# Keyboard game - falling letters

A simple falling letters game based on Canvas. Three difficulty levels can be set. Changing each difficulty level can be done in the "difficulty.ts" file. 



## Installation

No packages need to be installed to run the game (index.html). In case of code modification (typescript files in the "scripts" folder), installation of the necessary packages is required to regenerate the files into the "ts-built" folder.


```bash
  npm install 
```
